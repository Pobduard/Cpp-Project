# Cpp-Projects

Again Same as the Others, mainly for the "main" file, just in this case i actually dont remember which one is the latest.
was doing some test on code without a proper code editor and still have to fix them

In this case it's more similar to the Python file, cause C++ it's my 2nd (basic) learnd language, i started just coding into the file and adding more and more instructions and explanations to the code, only after i did quite a bit of it and realized it would be a good idea to do so, from what i recall atleast.

1. As always Brocode is the absolute GOAT and most if not all of that code is his originally from his YT tutorials âœ¨
2. Same as Mike Dane, absolute **GOAT** aswell and whom i started to learn C++ from ðŸ‘‘
